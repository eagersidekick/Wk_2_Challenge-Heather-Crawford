# Heather Crawford Coding Portfolio

This website is a coding portfolio for all of Heather Crawford's projects in KU's bootcamp.

## Description

This project contains a simple website that can act as a portfolio of projects as the KU coding bootcamp is completed. It contains an about me section detailing information potential employers may find useful, a section with links to all of my coding projects, a link to my resume, and links to important contacts.

## User Story

AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
